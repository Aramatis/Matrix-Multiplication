### Matrix Multiplication

Implements and evaluates the performance of a probabilistic algorithm that solves the problem of verifying if A x B = C 
with A, B and C matrixes of size n x n.

To run the experiments use your favourite IDE or in ubuntu, in the main folder run the following commands:

find -name "*.java" > sources.txt  
javac -d bin @sources.txt  
cd bin  
mkdir results  
java -classpath . experiments/Main  

The results will be saved in bin/results.
